## Project 1: How Did People with Different Occupations and Income Levels Vote?

I would like to use ANES Cumulative Data File to answer a question: how did people with different occupations and income levels vote? 
This question can be split into three major parts:
 1. Which income level group participate more in voting? high income or low income?
 2. Are there any party perferances between high income level people and low income people? 
 3. Does certain occupation type prefer to vote for a particular party?
